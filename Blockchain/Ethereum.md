## What is Ethereum?

Ethereum is a type of blockchain. To be more precise, a public blockchain.

> In the Ethereum universe, there is a single, canonical computer (called the Ethereum Virtual Machine, or EVM) whose state everyone on the Ethereum network agrees on. Everyone who participates in the Ethereum network (every Ethereum node) keeps a copy of the state of this computer.​
>
> Requests for computation are called transaction requests; the record of all transactions as well as the EVM’s present state is stored in the blockchain, which in turn is stored and agreed upon by all nodes.​
>
> Cryptographic mechanisms ensure that once transactions are verified as valid and added to the blockchain, they can’t be tampered with later; the same mechanisms also ensure that all transactions are signed and executed with appropriate “permissions” (no one should be able to send digital assets from Alice’s account, except for Alice herself).​

## Ethereum Smart Contracts

> A "smart contract" is simply a program that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. It's a collection of code (its functions) and data (its state) that resides at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain.​
>
> Smart contracts are a type of Ethereum account. This means they have a balance and they can send transactions over the network. However they're not controlled by a user, instead they are deployed to the network and run as programmed. User accounts can then interact with a smart contract by submitting transactions that execute a function defined on the smart contract. ​
>
> Smart contracts can define rules, like a regular contract, and automatically enforce them via the code.

## Solidity Programming Language

> Is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs which govern the behaviour of accounts within the Ethereum state.​
>
> Was influenced by C++, Python and JavaScript and is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).​
>
> Is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries and complex user-defined types among other features.​
>
> With Solidity you can create contracts for uses such as voting, crowdfunding, blind auctions, and multi-signature wallets
